# Index Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers a variety of index types, each designed for specific use cases. Understanding these different types will help you choose the right index for your specific needs.

## B-tree Indexes

B-tree (Balanced Tree) is the default index type in PostgreSQL and the most commonly used.

### When to use B-tree indexes:

- For columns used in equality comparisons (`=`)
- For range queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`, etc.)
- For `LIKE` queries with a constant prefix (e.g., `LIKE 'abc%'`)
- For `IN` operations
- For sorting operations (`ORDER BY`)

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

## Hash Indexes

Hash indexes are optimized specifically for equality comparisons.

### When to use Hash indexes:

- Only for simple equality operations (`=`)
- When you don't need range queries or sorting

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_status USING HASH ON users(status);
```

## GiST Indexes (Generalized Search Tree)

GiST indexes are versatile and support various data types and operations.

### When to use GiST indexes:

- For geometric data types (points, lines, polygons)
- For full-text search (though GIN is often better)
- For range types
- For nearest-neighbor searches

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_locations USING GIST ON locations(coordinates);
```

## GIN Indexes (Generalized Inverted Index)

GIN indexes are designed for handling cases where multiple values are stored in a single column.

### When to use GIN indexes:

- For array columns
- For JSON/JSONB data
- For full-text search
- When indexing multiple values in a single column

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_tags USING GIN ON documents(tags);
```

## BRIN Indexes (Block Range INdex)

BRIN indexes store summary information about ranges of blocks in a table.

### When to use BRIN indexes:

- For very large tables (millions of rows)
- When data is naturally ordered (timestamps, sequential IDs)
- When you need smaller indexes with acceptable performance trade-offs

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_logs_timestamp USING BRIN ON logs(created_at);
```

## SP-GiST Indexes (Space-Partitioned GiST)

SP-GiST supports partitioned search trees.

### When to use SP-GiST indexes:

- For non-balanced data structures
- For quad-trees, k-d trees, and radix trees
- For IP address ranges

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_network USING SPGIST ON networks(ip_range);
```

## Choosing the Right Index

Selecting the appropriate index type depends on:

1. The data type you're indexing
2. The types of queries you'll run
3. The size of your data
4. The write/read ratio of your application

Remember that indexes improve read performance but can slow down write operations. Always test your indexes with realistic data volumes and query patterns.
