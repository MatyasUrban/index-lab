# Creating Your First Index

In this practice exercise, you'll learn how to create a basic index on a PostgreSQL table and observe its performance benefits.

## Task

Create a B-tree index on the 'users' table for the 'email' column and verify its performance improvement.

## Instructions

1. First, examine the current query performance without an index:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user123@example.com';
   ```

2. Create a B-tree index on the email column:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);
   ```

3. Run the same query again with EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see the performance difference:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user123@example.com';
   ```

4. Compare the execution times and observe how PostgreSQL uses the index in the query plan.

## Expected Outcome

You should see a significant performance improvement after creating the index, especially for tables with many rows. The query plan should show that PostgreSQL is using an "Index Scan" instead of a "Sequential Scan".
