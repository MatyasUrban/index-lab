# Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index in a book.

## Why Use Indexes?

Without indexes, PostgreSQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more costly the operation.

If there is an index for the columns in the WHERE clause, PostgreSQL can use a more efficient method for locating the requested data. It can use the index to directly locate the rows that match the WHERE clause.

## Basic Index Types

PostgreSQL provides several index types:

- B-tree
- Hash
- GiST
- SP-GiST
- GIN
- BRIN

Each index type uses a different algorithm that is best suited to different types of queries. B-tree indexes are the default and are suitable for most common situations.

## Creating a Basic Index

Here's how to create a basic B-tree index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column_name);
```
