# Choosing the Right Index

In this practice exercise, you'll learn how to select the appropriate index type for different query patterns and data characteristics.

## Task

For the given table structure and query patterns, determine which index types would be most appropriate and implement them.

## Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2),
  category VARCHAR(50),
  tags TEXT[],
  location POINT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Query Patterns

1. Frequent equality searches on the category column:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics';
   ```

2. Range queries on price:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
   ```

3. Full-text search on description:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE description ILIKE '%wireless%';
   ```

4. Array containment queries on tags:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE tags @> ARRAY['wireless', 'bluetooth'];
   ```

5. Spatial queries on location:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE location <-> POINT(37.7749, -122.4194) < 10;
   ```

## Instructions

For each query pattern:
1. Identify the most appropriate index type
2. Create the index with the correct syntax
3. Test the query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
4. Document your reasoning for choosing each index type

## Expected Outcome

You should be able to create appropriate indexes for each query pattern and observe performance improvements in the query execution plans.
